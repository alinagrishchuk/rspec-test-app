# Learn behavior-driven development by developing realtime Rails applications

Rails 5 with real-time features is finally here! Ruby on Rails 5 - Behavior Driven Development (BDD), RSpec and Capybara provides a thorough introduction to BDD and using it to build web applications using the popular Ruby on Rails framework. Students in my courses routinely land lucrative jobs in the web app development world just using material taught in my courses, including (but not limited to) being Teaching Assistants!

Why BDD to build web applications? The advantages are numerous, and feature specs used extensively in BDD read like plain English which allow end users (business analysts, development teams, client teams among others) and developers to easily communicate with each other using BDD tools. In addition, it is easy for the end users to write the features themselves.

This course is designed for students who have some basic Ruby on Rails or web application development experience who want to take their skills to the next level but have limited or no experience in BDD, automated testing or using tools like RSpec, Capybara, Guard.
